function results = driver_autofiducialize
% use this function to autofiducialize single beatFiles using a seedFile and the settings set in this script
% the output 'results' is a [1 x totalNumOfBeatFiles struct array] with the fields:
%   - seedFilePath: this contains the full path to the seed file used
%   - beatFilePath: this contains the full path to the beat file
%   - seedFileName: filename of the seedFile used
%   - beatFileName: filename of the beatFile
%   - fiducials: this holds the fids structure belonging to beatFile. It will be generated via autofiducializing the beatFile using seedFile
%   - settings: this contains a struct called 'settings'. In it, all the settings for autofiducializing will be stored. It has the fields
%            - numLeadsToBeFiducialised:   the number of leads that it will use for autofiducialising
%            - leadsOfAllGroups: enter all the leads of potvals that are relevant here,  usually this should be set to:    leadsOfAllGroups = 1:size(potvals,2)
%            - demandedLeads:  the leads that should definitely used for autoprocessing. In the PFEIFER gui, you would enter them in the 'Leads for Autoprocessing' text field.
%            - badLeads: the badleads, in the 'global all leads of potvals' frame (as opposed to the 'group frame' in which u enter them in PFEIFER;
%            - fidsKernelLength
%            - window_width
%            - leadsToAutofiducialize:  the leads that will be used to autofiducialize.
%   - infostring: a string that you determine in this function. It can be anything you want to note about the results..
%
% % NOTE: None of the files given in this function are changed in any way using this function, they are just loaded..
